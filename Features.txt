# PhantomNet C2 Server Features

## Core Features

- **Dynamic IP and Hostname Updates**: Automatically updates Dynu DNS records every 8 hours for dynamic IP addresses and every 24 hours for hostname changes.
- **Proxy Scraping and Validation**: Scrapes and validates proxies to ensure reliable and anonymous communication.
- **Threat Intelligence Gathering**: Collects and analyzes threat intelligence data to enhance the effectiveness of attacks.
- **SQL Injection Exploitation**: Identifies and exploits SQL injection vulnerabilities in target databases.
- **Keylogging and Data Theft**: Installs keyloggers on target systems to capture sensitive data.
- **Web Exploitation**: Embeds JavaScript skimmers in e-commerce websites to capture credit card data.
- **Autonomous Telegram Bots**: Deploys Telegram bots to infiltrate and exfiltrate data from users' browsers and systems.

## Technical Specifications

- **Programming Languages**: Python, PHP, SQL
- **Web Framework**: Flask
- **Database**: SQLAlchemy (SQLite)
- **Reverse Proxy**: Nginx
- **SSL Certificates**: Let's Encrypt
- **Process Management**: Systemd
- **Dynamic DNS**: Dynu

## Deployment and Management

- **Automated Deployment Script**: A comprehensive script to deploy the C2 server on an Ubuntu VPS, handling system updates, dependency installation, firewall configuration, and service setup.
- **Systemd Services**: Manages the C2 server and Dynu updater as systemd services for reliable operation.
- **Nginx Configuration**: Configures Nginx as a reverse proxy to forward traffic to the Flask application.
- **SSL Setup**: Optional SSL certificate setup using Let's Encrypt for secure communication.

## Security and Anonymity

- **Firewall Configuration**: Sets up a robust firewall to allow only necessary incoming and outgoing traffic.
- **Data Encryption**: Ensures that all sensitive data is encrypted during transmission and storage.
- **Anonymous Communication**: Uses proxies and dynamic IP updates to maintain anonymity and avoid detection.

## Monitoring and Logging

- **System Logs**: All access and errors are logged for monitoring and auditing purposes.
- **Real-time Updates**: The Dynu updater script runs every 8 hours to ensure the server's IP and hostname are always up-to-date.

## Future Enhancements

- **Additional Exploitation Techniques**: Incorporate more advanced exploitation techniques and payload types.
- **Enhanced Threat Intelligence**: Integrate more sophisticated threat intelligence sources and analysis tools.
- **Improved Anonymity**: Explore additional methods to enhance the anonymity and resilience of the C2 server.
- **User Interface**: Develop a more intuitive and feature-rich web interface for easier management and monitoring.
