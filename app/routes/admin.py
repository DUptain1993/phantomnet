Copy every /admin/* route body from `phantom_c2_server.py`
into this file, replacing decorators like:

    @app.route('/admin/xyz', methods=['POST'])

with:

    @admin_bp.route('/xyz', methods=['POST'])

Import any models/utilities the routes need.  The giant dashboard HTML
function is also moved here unchanged.
